My idea for the final project for this class is a game that works similarly to the dinosaur game that pops up when Chrome has no internet. There would be a character that you control using space bar to jump up and down and obstacles would show up along the screen. I'd like to try and make the background move slowly to give the illusion that the character is actually going somewhere while staying in the same spot too. It would be somewhat similar to Flappy bird or like I mentioned, the Chrome dinosaur game. I think some issues I'll have may be how to impliment sprites instead of just shapes and then also getting the obstacles to move. My work plan is to start this week and work on getting the sprites and background figured out and implimented, working on getting them moving next week, and then the 3rd week having the character interact with the obstacles and adding a score board, title, and end screen. I've already started looking at what I'm gonna do for the sprite and obstacles so far.
